The Group had entered into various agreements with the Bawri Group (\"BG\") for acquisition of 76% stake in Dalmia Cement\n(North East) Limited ('DCNEL') (formerly known as Calcom Cements India Limited). Due to failure of BG to comply with certain\nconditions specified under the Share Holders Agreement (SHA), the Group demanded compliance with certain clauses of SHA\nincluding transfer their remaining shareholdings in DCNEL at Re.1/, which was disputed by BG. The said disputes were referred\nto Arbitral Tribunal, which delivered its award on 20th March 2021. The Award was challenged by the Group before the Hon'ble\nDelhi High Court (\"DHC\"), who vide judgement dated 17th October 2022, set aside the award and asked De-novo arbitration\nproceedings.

However, during the earlier quarter ended 30th June 2024, JAL was admitted into\nCorporate Insolvency Resolution Process (\"CIRP\") by Allahabad Bench of National Company Law Tribunal.\nThe claim filed by DCBL with the Interim Resolution Professional has been partially admitted, and the remaining claim is under\nverification.
